## **Overview of Belly Button Biodiversity Analysis** 
* Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer . 
The visualization will help the volunteers to identify the 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

* When a sample ID is selected from the dropdown menu, the bar chart, bubble chart and gauge chart are all updated according to the ID that is selected.
